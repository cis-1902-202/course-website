## üíª Development

Coming soon!
{/\* There are many ways to write JavaScript, and JavaScript is used for many different purposes, from mobile apps to command line scripts, and of course in the browser. This is a guide for how you can get started writing JS in an environment that will suit you well for this course and future projects you take on in JS.

__For Windows users:__

One of the main appeals of web development is that products work on all devices regardless of OS. That being said, there can be some difficulties when developing web apps from different OS's - particularly Windows. This is why we recommend **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** for development on Windows systems. This is a Microsoft-made tool which allows you to run a lightweight Linux system inside Windows, making your developer experience more convenient.

</Alert>

If you're on Windows, follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to set up WSL. We also recommend using [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701) to access your Linux subsystem once it is installed. You can then follow the rest of this guide as written using WSL.

<Alert mdx type="danger">
  If you instead choose to develop on Windows without WSL, expect to spend some
  time debugging and looking around for answers when things don't work quite as
  expected when installing dependencies and submitting work. The teaching staff
  will work with you to mitigate these problems!

## üìù Picking a code editor

In this class, we recommend using **VSCode** as your code editor. If you want to use a different editor, that's totally fine, but we may not be able to help you with specific issues you run into.
Another popular editor that is specific to Python is **PyCharm**.
