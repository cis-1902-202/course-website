## üìù Picking a code editor

In this class, we recommend using **VSCode** as your code editor. If you want to use a different editor, that's totally fine, but we may not be able to help you with specific issues you run into.
Another popular editor that is specific to Python is **PyCharm**.

## üíª Development

<Alert mdx type="warning">
__For Windows users:__

This development guide was written with macOS and Linux users in mind. 

We recommend using **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** for development on Windows systems. This is a Microsoft-made tool which allows you to run a lightweight Linux system inside Windows, making your developer experience more convenient.
If you install it, you can follow the rest of this guide as written using WSL.

It's not *required* to use WSL, but it will make your life a LOT easier. It's also going to be harder for the Staff to help you through any issues you run into if you're not using WSL.

### Pyenv

Pyenv is a great tool that allows us to manage multiple Python versions on 
our device. This is sometimes necessary since different projects might be on
different versions.

If you have `brew`, you can install`pyenv` with the following command:

```bash
brew update
brew install pyenv
```

If you don't have `brew`, you should [get it](https://brew.sh/) üôÉ... It's a fairly popular package manager for macOS and Linux systems!

If you choose not to get `brew`, or you're on Windows, you can also use the automatic installer script provided by `pyenv`:

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

You'll also want to set up your shell environment for Pyenv, which you can do by adding the following to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

For `.bashrc`:

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

For `.zshrc`:
```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

After you've added this to your shell profile, you'll need to reload your shell profile by running `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`.

Note that these instructions are from a [section on the pyenv README](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv),
and they have more information on setting up `pyenv` for different shells, including if you would like to add these commands to your shell profile automatically.

### Poetry

In this class, we will be using `poetry` as our package manager. It's much younger than `pip`, which is the default package manager for Python, but it's much more powerful, and in my opinion, much easier to use.

To install `poetry`, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

<Alert mdx>
If you are using Windows and not using WSL (or you just want more advanced installation options!), you can checkout the [Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) for more information.
</Alert>

In this class, all the assignments will have a `pyproject.toml` file that will specify the dependencies for the project. You can install these dependencies by running `poetry install` in the directory where the `pyproject.toml` file is located.
During the assignment, you might want to use more dependencies than originally specified, and you can do that by running `poetry add <package-name>`.

During these assignments, you should also run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment that `poetry` creates for you. This will allow you to run the scripts you write in the assignment.

### Venv (optional information)

This will not be used in this class, but it's good to know about since it's fairly popular still. It's a module provided by Python that enables virtual environment creation. The main commands to know are:

```bash
# create the env
python3 -m venv {whatever_you_want_to_name_your_env}

# activate the env (similar to poetry shell)
source {whatever_you_want_to_name_your_env}/bin/activate

# once you're done with the env
deactivate
```

Note that there are SOOOOO many other ways to manage virtual environments including Pipenv, conda, and more. We're just going to be using `poetry` in this class, but most of the other options are also quite similar.

Check out this funny StackOverflow [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe?noredirect=1&lq=1) that was made over 7 years ago about the different virtual environment tools in Python. It's still relevant today!
